## Lectures

#### 1. Decision-Making & Irrationality

- Key words: 

  	- _Crockery story_ -  C. K. (1998). Less is better: When low value options are valued more highly than high value options
  	- The evaluability hypothesis ("The Dictionary Story")
  	- _Preference reversal_ - change in preferences or evaluations even though the attributes of the objects remain the same.

  - [_Good vs bad memories_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgRlrBl-7Yg)
  - _Availability heuristics_ 
    - people rely on immediate examples that come to mind when considering a situation
    - people make decisions based on the immediate information
    - which information is processed is influenced by context (Kahneman colonoscopy - pain peaking in the end vs pain peaking in the middle)
  - _Loss aversion_ = tendency to invest more into avoiding losses than into achieving gains,
    - when negative information is present we tend to give it special attention and prioritize it
  - [_Control of decisions_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X68dm92HVI)  
    - Presence of worse option makes the first option seem better than it is
    - People are predictably unpredictable
  - _Planning Fallacy_ - people tend to consider only best-case scenarios when planning and usually disregard "statistics" on actual success rate of previous similar attempts because unexpected events are not considered

- Summary: 

  - Our decisions and  behaviours are dependent on __immediate__ cues previously associated with _motivational states_ or _general human heuristic systems_ rather than global judgement of advantages and disadvantages in different situations.

#### 2. Emotion, motivation and regulation of behaviour

- Misattribution of arousal 
  - Emotional experience = physiological changes (arousal) + cognitive interpretation of the situation
  - If a person is aroused he will attribute this arousal to the most "meaningful" interpretation available at the moment -> risk of Misattribution of arousal
- Motivation
- Priming = previously processed stimuli influence the processing of subsequent stimuli
  - Hard to replicate, not conclusive
- Classical Conditioning 
  - Implication for humans = Cues in the environment previously associated with motivational states will become triggers of those motivational states in the future regardless of whether the reward/punishment is present.
- Instrumental Learning
  - Object and situations can trigger automatic behavioural responses == Habits.
- Emotion regulation
  - It's easier to get rid of triggers than to actively battle them.
    1. Choose situation
    2. Change situation
    3. Divert attention
    4. Change thinking - changing your outlook on a situation changes your physiological reaction as well
    5. Act as if nothing happened
- [Ego depletion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvvQrqIRLGU)

#### 3. Social perception and social influence

- Behaviour = f ( Person, Environment)

- [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=760lwYmpXbc)

- Us vs them mentality 

  - _[Class Divided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mcCLm_LwpE)_ - How dividing people into socially unequal groups based on physical attributes can affect their feelings and treatment of each other

- Self-fulfilling prophecy - 

  - <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JiGTKfU.png" alt="SFP" style="zoom: 80%;" />

    

- [Milgram's obedience experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYLCy5PVgM)

  - Participants asked to administer shock to subject of questioning as a form of punishment
  - Problems: Experimenter bias, Selective reporting, Underestimated failed manipulation

- [Bystander effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSsPfbup0ac)

  - Diffusion of responsibility - expectation that help will come from elsewhere
  - Similar to SFP

- Social facilitation vs social loafing

  - "More people are pulling the rope, less effort is individual giving"
  - SF 
    - Competition
    - Self-presentation
    - Feedback - comparison
    - Since environment is competitive it has _negative_ effect on people with low self-esteem and social anxiety
  - SL 
    - Cooperation
    - Coordination loss
    - Motivation loss = belief my contribution is dispensable
  - Aspect determining SF vs SL:
    1. Evaluation of individual efforts
    2. Evaluation apprehension 

- [Conformity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYIh4MkcfJA) - Asch. S.E.(1955) - Simple question about line length - only one real participant, rest are dummies who mark the wrong answer, participant also marks the wrong answer if he'd be the only one = __he conforms__

- Irrationality in science

  1. Confirmation bias("Experimenter effect") - overstate supporting evidence, downplay other evidence

  2. Congruence bias - looking for evidence supporting the theory and not the other way around

  3. Observer-expectancy effect - subconscious manipulation of experiment to achieve desired result

  4. Hindsight bias - modifying hypotheses after results (post-hoc) 

     ​						  - "Texas Sharpshooter"

  5. Availability heuristic - disregarding previous body of research

  6. Publication bias - non-significant results not seen as publishable

#### 4. Social perceptions and self-perceptions

* _Hindsight bias_ = tendency to perceive the already-know outcomes of an event as much more predictable than they were + feeling of knowing the outcome beforehand

  * Bias persists even if the participants are told to disregard what they've been told about different outcomes
  * Three levels - 
    1. Predictability - Self-serving bias 
    2. Inevitability - Seeing the event chain makes us unable to un-see
    3. Memory distortion - We simply don't remember correctly all the facts, constructive nature of memory, false remembering

* [_Cognitive dissonance_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_lCO2cBNts)

  * When two counteracting beliefs are acted simultaneously it creates dissonance we try to solve. 
  * When our _conduct_ and our _beliefs_ clash, often will the beliefs change to _conform_ (or explain) our conduct. Many times this manifests in the form of excuses like "Its for the greater good" or "No one will know", especially when the conduct is immoral or otherwise wrong.

* [_Fundamental attribution error_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdrDAik86rc) - "I did something wrong because of the situation I was in and others did something wrong because they are like that" = tendency for people to under-emphasize situational explanations for an individual's observed behaviour while over-emphasizing dispositional and personality-based explanations for their behaviour

  |                    | Me        | Others    |
  | ------------------ | --------- | --------- |
  | Positive behaviour | Trait     | Situation |
  | Negative behaviour | Situation | Trait     |

  

* [_Self-serving bias_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HVaJt3xicM) - collecting/perceiving information in a way to support our pre-existing views or self interest

* [_Barnum effect_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2HoscBLIw) - perceiving general statements as tailored specifically to an individual on personal level ( horoscopes, personality tests )

  * Generality of interpretation = true of almost all people but allow "projection" of many different experiences that are unique
  * Interpretation presented as personalized = people fail to think about generality of statements when they are presented as personal descriptions
  * Favourability = statements suggesting positive traits are more likely to be seen as accurate (we like to think we are good in nature :P)
  * Revelations = may point to issues that are common in all people but are considered private

* [_Halo effect_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEho_4ejkNw) = tendency of our first impression of a person to "frame" our global impression of him/her in the future (for example good looking people are perceived as morally good with no evidence)

* _False consensus effect_ - tendency to overestimate how much other people agree with us, viewing our values and ides as "normal"

* __Conclusion__: knowledge of biases helps us be more honest but its demanding to be constantly aware of all these things and therefore biases may serve as heuristics - 'just in case' judgments if information processing is limited 

#### 5. Human perception, memory, and thought

* Eyewitness testimony problems:
  * Conformity 
  * Suggestibility
  * Increasing certainty
  * Unconscious transference
* [Interrogation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB2OegI6wvI) - contamination of memory occur when feeding people misinformation through suggestive questioning leading to false testimonies ( Final Task 3.)
* [Planting of false memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB2OegI6wvI) - success ranging from 25% - 50%
* We need to account for the fact that memory is constructive, it doesn't work like a hard drive, memories can be altered by current state of subject
* Types of memory -
  * Episodic memory
  * Semantic memory
  * Procedural memory
* [Inattentional blindness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSxSQsspiQ) - occurs when attention is not drawn to the stimuli at the moment of change

#### 6. Development of personality and pathology

* [Piaget's stages of development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRF27F2bn-A)
  * Sensorimotor ( birth to 18 to 24 months)
  * Preoperational (18-24 through early childhood 7 years)
  * Concrete operational (7-12)
  * Formal operational (12+)

* [Learned helplessness](https://is.muni.cz/auth/el/phil/jaro2020/PSX_512/um/Seligman_helplessness.pdf?predmet=1225871;qurl=%2Fel%2Fphil%2Fjaro2020%2FPSX_512%2Findex.qwarp) = is a state that occurs after a subject has experienced a stressful situation repeatedly. They come to believe that they are unable to control or change the situation, so they do not try — even when opportunities for change become available.

* [Negative effect of criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Study) - effect of negative criticism on performance through increase self-consciousness 

* Scaffolding the development - some tasks are doable for children only with supervision, but with supervision they are able to learn the tasks

  1. current understanding - can work unassisted
  2. zone of proximal development - learns with supervision
  3. out of reach - can't do

* [Attachment theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjOowWxOXCg)

  |           | High anxiety |          |
  | --------- | :----------: | -------- |
  | AVOIDANCE |   <- ^  ->   | APPROACH |
  |           | LOW ANXIETY  |          |

  1. Securely attached (bottom right) - good self image
  2. Anxious ambivalent (top right) - slightly poor self image
  3. Anxious avoidant (bottom left) - poor self image
  4. Anxious disorganized (top left) - very poor self image

  

## Final Task

​	To pass the colloquium you have to be prepared to answer any of these 15 questions. I've written what biases and topics from the courses are necessary to know to be able to answer each question. Feel free to edit it further or provide more detailed answers.

### 1. Mike and his alcoholic father

>  Mike lives with his dad, who has a problem with alcohol abuse. When Mike started school, his drunken dad mocked and teased him every time he saw him doing his homework, calling him “good little sissy boy”. Mike soon ceased doing his schoolwork altogether and instead started to mock and tease his hard-working classmates. Among teachers and parents, he has become to be known as “the kid with the drunken father”, and everybody knows they should not expect too much of him. His homeroom teacher once said: “Mike, I already know it is a lost cause to expect you to do your homework, but I wish you could at least once in a while come to school on time.” But Mike never does. Which are the different kinds of psychological mechanisms that shape and maintain Mike’s problem behaviour? Do you have any suggestions how Mike’s situation could be somehow improved?

* Self fulfilling prophecy : 

  > "Mike, I already know it is a lost cause to expect you to do your homework,"

* Negative effect of criticism:

  > calling him “good little sissy boy”

* Improvement could be done by introducing authority who'd believe in Mike.

### 2. Susan falling into river with Jack laughing

> Susan and Jack went on a walk in a forest. As they were trying to cross a stream by jumping over it, the mud on the other bank gave way, Susan’s foot slipped, and she tumbled into the icy-cold water face down, drenching her clothes completely. Jack laughed heartily; Susan, however, cried all the way home. Seeing that Susan was not talking to him, Jack tried to lighten up the situation by telling jokes and calling Susan “my little mermaid”, but this only made the situation worse. “You are always such a jerk!” Susan cried. “You care nothing about other people’s feelings, just so that you always have it your way! Obviously you must have seen that the stream was too wide to cross, but you still forced me to jump! And on top of that, you laugh your head off when I fall!” Jack, now getting vexed as well, replied: “No! It’s you who’s a total crybaby! Remember how you whimpered over the wasp sting all day? That’s just how you are! You should have seen yourself – everyone would have laughed in such a situation. Why, on earth, did you jump in that place anyway?? Everybody could have seen the bank was not safe in that part, those grasses always grow on liquid mud! You just got what you deserved.” Which biasing tendencies that we covered throughout the course can be potentially detected in Susan and Jack’s conversation? Why did they react the way they did?

* Susan:

  * Hindsight bias:

    > Obviously you must have seen that the stream was too wide to cross

  * Fundamental attribution error:

    > “You are always such a jerk!” 

* Jack:

  * False consensus error:

    > -everyone would have laughed in such a situation
    >
    > -everybody could have seen the bank was not safe in that part, 

  * Fundamental attribution error:

    > whimpered over the wasp sting all day? That’s just how you are!

### 3. Broken glasses during main break in school

> During the main break, somebody took the teacher’s glasses from the desk. After a brief search, they were found broken in the opposite corner of the classroom. Several well-known troublemakers were under suspicion as similar incidents – though not as serious – had happened before. However, there was  no direct evidence. The teacher decided to interrogate the students one by one. The first few students claimed there was a lot of commotion in the room during the break, and they couldn’t be sure who took the glasses or what they did with them. To help the students remember, the teacher asked questions like: “Did you see who took the glasses? Didn’t you hear the noise when he smashed them against the wall? Did you also hear the boys laughing? Whose laugh was it? Come on, I’m sure you can remember, you just have to try harder! Any detail may be important. When exactly did you hear the noise?” What is the most likely result of this kind of interrogation? What does the teacher assume, and which problems does she not take into consideration?

* Suggestive questioning may lead to false memories of the event. I'd say the teacher is also trying to collect evidence to support her theory ( Congruence bias). Laughing could've been independent.

### 4. Moron boss or forgetful employees !!!!

> During office meetings, Eve’s boss often reprimands everyone for not taking care of “important issues” she claims to have pointed out at previous meetings. Eve feels uncomfortable – she really does not remember being given any of those assignments. While listening to the boss’s complaints, everyone just sits silently with downcast eyes and says nothing. After the meeting, Eve usually asks around about the assignments, but nobody seems to remember. “I guess Boss is either just misremembering things, or she wants us to take the blame for something she’s messed up. I’m pretty sure she’s never told us to do those things,” one colleague tells Eve. A similar situation occurs in the following meeting, with similar results. “I guess boss is a total moron,” Eve concludes. What are the most likely psychological phenomena that gave rise to this situation? What do you think would help to overcome this problem?

* Fundamental attribution error.

* Cognitive dissonance:

  >I’m pretty sure she’s never told us to do those things,” one colleague tells Eve.

### 5. Free trial at many companies

> Many companies today adopt a ‘free trial’ marketing strategy in which they let the customer ‘try out’ the product for several weeks or months for free. After that, the customer can either purchase the product or return/stop using it without any financial or other commitments. This strategy turns out to work very well: Even people who initially did not plan to buy the product often end up doing so after the free trial period, although their general attitude to the product (its quality, usefulness, etc.) has not changed. Why do you think this happens?

* Possible loss aversion: after a certain time we feel like the product is ours and giving it back could be similar to loosing it. 
* They might view the product as more reliable.
* Most peoples utilize free trails to get most out of them; which will create a routine in their minds and can eventually make your product necessary for them.

### 6. Andrew's very strict mother

>When Andrew was little, his mother criticized him for every action that annoyed or distracted her somehow, calling him “the most annoying little brat”. By the time he started high school, Andrew believed everyone would find him annoying if he gathered courage to talk to them. When his classmates approached him, he was too anxious about what to say, and even when he started talking, he would often stop mid-sentence and finish with something like: “...but I know this is boring, don’t mind me, I’m just blabbering.” He was also very vigilant about any signs of boredom or annoyance in others. When he saw his classmate’s eyes wander during conversation, he’d immediately say: “Am I bothering you? Sorry, I’ll shut up now.” Soon enough, he was pretty sure nobody was too eager to talk to him: Indeed, his mother was right that he was extremely annoying. What is Andrew’s greatest problem? Was his mother right all along?

*  His self image is negative and he therefore projects this idea of his self image onto others, who then might start perceiving him as such (case of self fulfilling prophecy).
* His mother is also a case of self fulfilling prophecy where because she was so strict and reprimanded any showing of emotion Andrew became self aware and started looking at himself as if he was a bother to others.

### 7. Sarah's ego depletion

>  Sarah has decided to adopt a dramatically healthier lifestyle. She wakes up two hours earlier than she used to, goes running, has a cold shower and eats a super-healthy breakfast before she goes to work. In  the afternoon, she plans to do some housework and study English but instead finds herself turning on the TV and switching from one channel to another until late in the night, with a pack of cookies at hand. Before going to sleep, she feels remorse and makes a promise to start anew in the morning. The “cycle” repeats itself for a few days until Sarah completely drops her fitness plans and gets more and more overweight. When her friend invites her to join a highly successful fitness programme, Sarah refuses: “I have tried so many times to no avail. I already know it just won’t work.” What do you think Sarah’s problem is? 

* Since Sarah decided to implement so many changes at once she must put in great effort to stay on track with so many "healthy options" and therefore she "runs out" of self control in the afternoon and slips into old habits. This is why change should be implemented in small increments and must be first successfully turned into habit.

### 8.  SPE, Milgram, Blue eyes-brown eyes

>  Think about the Stanford Prison Experiment, Milgram’s obedience experiments, and Jane Elliott’s “blue eyes – brown eyes exercise” (from Class Divided). What do all of these “demonstrations” have in common? In general, what do we know about human behaviour based on this research? Which conclusions can we draw from these studies about social influence on human behaviour? Which conclusions that the authors drew, on the other hand, cannot be unequivocally drawn from the data, based on the recently uncovered evidence? Discuss how students should go about interpreting this kind of research – how can we differentiate between the actual evidence and misconceptions? 

* People accept the responsibilities associated with a certain role.
* Responsibility can shift
* That distinction between good and bad people might be impossible 

### 9.  Underachieving kid from far away

> Imagine you are tutoring a child who has moved with her parents to your town from a faraway country. You are trying to teach the child to solve different kinds of problems and complete tasks as expected from any pupil of that age. However, despite your efforts, the child keeps falling behind and is making virtually no progress. What are the different things you should consider as you try to find the reason for this lack of success? What are the potential different sources of underachievement in the child?

* Cultural differences might play a big role since we would expect a child of certain age to go through a certain amount of education but this is culture specific, so the child might've never been presented with a stimuli which would encourage the development we take for granted.

### 10. Steven threw a fit against his sloppy students

> Steven works as an assistant professor and teaches a course in which students are required to submit written homework assignments on time. The essays are of variable quality, and he is often disappointed by some students’ lack of effort but tries to mark the essays fairly. Today, Steven got a pack of coffee candy from his colleague, which he previously never tasted. It was delicious, and before he knew it, it was completely gone. As he started marking essays that afternoon, he suddenly realized he had enough of his students’ sloppy work. It was inexcusable! He was very angry – he has been holding it in all this time, but now he obviously couldn’t put up with it any longer. He put together a list of names of students whose work he considered sloppy and wrote a sarcastic email to the entire class mocking the individual students’ “extraordinary ability to mess up absolutely everything”. The day after sending the email, Steven suddenly felt appalled that he did what he did. He simply could not understand what got into him and didn’t know how to face the consequences. Can you explain what happened to Steven?

* Misattribution of arousal 

### 11. Old bickering couple

> You hear an elderly couple talking in a group of people: SHE: “I had no idea he was taken to the hospital!” HE: “Oh, yes, you did. We heard he was sick. On Friday his daughter came to ask us help with the corn because he was taken to the hospital.” SHE: “What are you saying? She never said anything about hospital. She asked for help because it started raining and the corn was still out.” HE: “Raining! We haven’t seen any rain since May! It’s parched!” SHE: “Yes, but it started raining on Friday afternoon! Don’t you remember? You were out chasing the chicken that got out of the coop. It was just a little but it looked like a storm was coming. I even told you I needed to get the laundry in so it didn’t get wet but you just kept grumbling to me about Brandon never fixing the coop. Then Betty came and asked us to help bring in the corn.” HE: “She asked us because Tom was sick. Don’t tease me, woman! I’d surely had known if there had been any rain! I clearly remember she said daddy was sick in the hospital so could Brandon and us come and help with the corn.” What do you think might be going on? Why do the two recollections differ? Do you find any of the two versions more plausible? Why (not)?

* Inattentional blindness
* Cognitive dissonance

### 12. Trio dealing with thesis

> Maggie, Lucy and Linda all should be working on their final theses. However, it is still long before the deadline, and even the slightest idea of the thesis is very stressful to all of them and puts them in a bad mood for days. The three students deal with this situation differently: Maggie avoids thinking about the thesis and uses various distractions to maintain a positive mood. Lucy tries to perceive the thesis in a matter-of-fact way as a technical problem that need to be solved as quickly as possible with as little effort as possible. Linda spends every day in front of a computer screen with an open document, telling herself to keep calm, forget about stress and maintain a positive attitude about the thesis. Which of these anti-stress strategies do you think is the most effective one and why?

* Maggie avoids
* Lucy has technical approach 
* Linda actively fights the anxiety
* In my opinion Maggie or Lucy has the best approach since Maggie is unbothered by the anxiety inducing thoughts unless she's working on a thesis and Lucy's cold approach makes her see the problem as it is, she's not blowing it out of proportion

### 13. Preschool Peter and his dad's toothache

> Little Peter’s dad has a bad toothache. Peter, who is of preschool age, feels bad about his daddy’s situation. His mother is touched by this and with the good intent of promoting altruistic tendencies in her son even further, she tells Peter to “try to think about something that would cheer his dad up”. Peter rushes away and, to her astonishment, comes back with a huge ice lolly she got him earlier that day because he wanted it so much but had to save it for after dinner. “Here, dad,” Peter says, “eat this ice lolly, it will cheer you up. Mom got it for me because I wanted it but I guess you need it more than I do.” The poor parents didn’t know how to break it to Peter that people with toothaches cannot eat ice cream. What mistake did Peter’s mom make that led to the awkward situation? Let’s say that the parents explain the situation to Peter, and he understands. Next time, he’ll try to cheer his dad up in a more appropriate way. This is different from a situation in which Peter would not understand even if his parents explained it to him. What is the term that psychology uses to describe the stage of development in which the child is able to complete a particular task, but will not do it without the guidance of other people?

* When Peter tries to think of something to cheer his dad up he is only able to use his own point of view, he's not yet able to imagine other person's perspective and therefore brings and object which would cheer him up.
* Scaffolding - Zone of proximal development

### 14. Unmotivated students of Mr. Harrison

> Mr. Harrison’s students are – like all third year students – preparing invitations for the celebration of the school’s 100th anniversary. Invitations will be sent out to thousands of people, and each of them needs to be individually hand-folded, signed and wrapped, with an address written on the top. The students meet every afternoon in their classroom and prepare the invitations together while sitting in a circle around a giant box where the invitations are thrown. There’s still a lot of work to do, but Mr.  Harrison’s students are still not done with the invitations. To his dismay, Mr. Harrison finds out that Mrs. Richards’s class is almost done with theirs! After visiting Mrs. Richards’s classroom, he discovers that her students are silent while working individually at their desks. Indeed, Mrs. Richards is much stricter than Mr. Harrison, but desperate times require desperate measures – so Mr. Harrison forbids his students to talk while they are working on the invitations to increase productivity. He is, however, disappointed to find that his class has never become as productive as Mrs. Richards’s. What do you think is the main cause of the difference in productivity between Mrs. Richards’s and Mr. Harrison’s classes? What could you recommend to Mr. Harrison to increase his class’s productivity? 

* Example of social loafing; the class puts letters into the same box so a contribution of one classmate seems minimal -> this leads into lack of motivation and that leads -> into people conforming to the speed at which others are folding the letters.
* What Mr. Harrison could do is introduce some form of competition, maybe a reward for those who would produce most letters or something like that.

### 15. Sly salesman employing every tactic in the book

> A salesman is promoting a set of “high-quality kitchenware.” He claims the new set of products is very popular, and to celebrate the company’s successful start up, they have issued scratch tickets with which potential customers can win a prize. First, he hands you a ticket. After scratching, it reads that you won 10,000 crowns. “Congratulations! Now you can use this ticket as a coupon for one of our exclusive products. With the coupon, you can have the basic set of four pots and two pans ONLY for 8,000 – as you can see, the original prize was 18,000! Now you can save the 10,000 for a nice dinner with your family. However, the premium set with three additional pots and a set of high-quality knives only costs – for you, that is – 9,000 crowns! The other company sells an almost identical set without knives for 22,000. And that’s not everything! If you buy now, you’ll get this exclusive knife sharpener for free! Otherwise, it would cost additional 1,500. Isn’t it amazing?” Which techniques, based on the knowledge of human psychology, does the salesman use to attract customers? What kind of person, do you think, is most and least likely to yield to the salesman’s promotion efforts and buy the offered product? 

* Loss aversion: if I had already won 10000 I don't want to lose them

* Evaluability effect: He immediately presents a second option from other company that's suboptimal to make us think his offer is way better

* Someone who's easily pressured, highly conforming, low in confidence

* Risk aversion?: 

  > If you buy now, you’ll get this exclusive knife sharpener for free!
