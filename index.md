1. #### Decision-Making & Irrationality

   - Key words: 

     	- _Crockery story_ - Hsee, C. K. (1998). Less is better: When low value options are valued more highly than high value options
     	- The evaluability hypothesis ("The Dictionary Story")
     	- _Preference reversal_ - change in preferences or evaluations even though the attributes of the objects remain the same.

     - _Good vs bad memories_
     - _Availability heuristics_ 
       - people rely on immediate examples that come to mind when considering a situation
       - people make decisions based on the immediate information
       - which information is processed is influenced by context (Kahneman colonoscopy - pain peaking in the end vs pain peaking in the middle)
     - _Control of decisions_ - Ariely  
       - Presence of worse option makes the first option seem better than it is
       - People are predictably unpredictable
     - _Planning Fallacy_ - people tend to consider only best-case scenarios when planning and usually disregard "statistics" on actual success rate of previous similar attempts because unexpected events are not considered

   - Summary: 

     - Our decisions and  behaviours are dependent on __immediate__ cues previously associated with _motivational states_ or _general human heuristic systems_ rather than global judgement of advantages and disadvantages in different situations.

2. #### Emotion, motivation and regulation of behaviour

   - Misattribution of arousal 

     - Emotional experience = physiological changes (arousal) + cognitive interpretation of the situation
     - If a person is aroused he will attribute this arousal to the most "meaningful" interpretation available at the moment -> risk of MoA

   - Motivation

   - Priming = previously processed stimuli influence the processing of subsequent stimuli

     - Hard to replicate, not conclusive

   - Classical Conditioning 

     - Implication for humans = Cues in the environment previously associated 

       with motivational states will become triggers of those motivational states in the future regardless of whether the reward/punishment is present.

   - Instrumental Learning

     - Object and situations can trigger automatic behavioural respones == Habits.

   - Emotion regulation

     - It's easier to get rid of triggers than to actively battle them.
       1. Choose situation
       2. Change situation
       3. Divert attention
       4. Change thinking - changing your outlook on a situation changes your physiological reaction as well
       5. Act as if nothing happened

   - Ego depletion

3. #### Social perception and social influence

   - Behaviour = f ( Person, Enviroment)

   - Stanford Prison Experiment

   - Us vs them mentality 

     - _[Class Divided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mcCLm_LwpE)_ 

   - Self-fulfilling prophecy - 

     - <img src="D:\D\Untitled.png" alt="SFP" style="zoom: 80%;" />

       

   - Milgram's obedience experiments

     - Participants asked to administer shock to subject of questioning as a form of punishment
     - Problems: Experimenter bias, Selective reporting, Underestimated failed manipulation

   - Bystander effect

   - Conformity

   - Irrationality in science

     1. Confirmation bias("Experimenter effect") - overstate supporting evidence, downplay other evidence
     2. Congruence bias - looking for evidence supporting the theory and not the other way around
     3. Observer-expectancy effect - subconscious manipulation of experiment to achieve desired result
     4. Hindsight bias - modifying hypotheses after results
     5. Availability heuristic - disregarding previous body of research
     6. Publication bias - non-significant results not seen as publishable

4. #### Social perceptions and self-perceptions

5. #### Human perception, memory, and thought

6. #### Development of personality and pathology
