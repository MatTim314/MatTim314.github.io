## Lectures

#### 1. Decision-Making & Irrationality

- Key words: 

  	- _Crockery story_ - Hsee, C. K. (1998). Less is better: When low value options are valued more highly than high value options
  	- The evaluability hypothesis ("The Dictionary Story")
  	- _Preference reversal_ - change in preferences or evaluations even though the attributes of the objects remain the same.

  - _Good vs bad memories_
  - _Availability heuristics_ 
    - people rely on immediate examples that come to mind when considering a situation
    - people make decisions based on the immediate information
    - which information is processed is influenced by context (Kahneman colonoscopy - pain peaking in the end vs pain peaking in the middle)
  - _Control of decisions_ - Ariely  
    - Presence of worse option makes the first option seem better than it is
    - People are predictably unpredictable
  - _Planning Fallacy_ - people tend to consider only best-case scenarios when planning and usually disregard "statistics" on actual success rate of previous similar attempts because unexpected events are not considered

- Summary: 

  - Our decisions and  behaviours are dependent on __immediate__ cues previously associated with _motivational states_ or _general human heuristic systems_ rather than global judgement of advantages and disadvantages in different situations.

#### 2. Emotion, motivation and regulation of behaviour

- Misattribution of arousal 

  - Emotional experience = physiological changes (arousal) + cognitive interpretation of the situation
  - If a person is aroused he will attribute this arousal to the most "meaningful" interpretation available at the moment -> risk of MoA

- Motivation

- Priming = previously processed stimuli influence the processing of subsequent stimuli

  - Hard to replicate, not conclusive

- Classical Conditioning 

  - Implication for humans = Cues in the environment previously associated 

    with motivational states will become triggers of those motivational states in the future regardless of whether the reward/punishment is present.

- Instrumental Learning

  - Object and situations can trigger automatic behavioural respones == Habits.

- Emotion regulation

  - It's easier to get rid of triggers than to actively battle them.
    1. Choose situation
    2. Change situation
    3. Divert attention
    4. Change thinking - changing your outlook on a situation changes your physiological reaction as well
    5. Act as if nothing happened

- Ego depletion

#### 3. Social perception and social influence

- Behaviour = f ( Person, Enviroment)

- Stanford Prison Experiment

- Us vs them mentality 

  - _[Class Divided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mcCLm_LwpE)_ 

- Self-fulfilling prophecy - 

  - <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JiGTKfU.png" alt="SFP" style="zoom: 80%;" />

    

- Milgram's obedience experiments

  - Participants asked to administer shock to subject of questioning as a form of punishment
  - Problems: Experimenter bias, Selective reporting, Underestimated failed manipulation

- Bystander effect

  - Diffusion of responsibility - expectation that help will come from elsewhere
  - Similar to SFP

- Social facilitation vs social loafing

  - "More people are pulling the rope, less effort is individual giving"
  - SF 
    - Competition
    - Self-presentation
    - Feedback - comparison
    - Since enviroment is competitive it has _negative_ effect on people with low self-esteem and social anxiety
  - SL 
    - Cooperation
    - Coordination loss
    - Motivation loss = belief my contribution is dispensable
  - Aspect determining SF vs SL:
    1. Evaluation of individual efforts
    2. Evaluation apprehension 

- Conformity - Asch. S.E.(1955) - Simple question about line length - only one real participant, rest are dummies who mark the wrong answer, participant also marks the wrong answer if he'd be the only one = __he conforms__

- Irrationality in science

  1. Confirmation bias("Experimenter effect") - overstate supporting evidence, downplay other evidence

  2. Congruence bias - looking for evidence supporting the theory and not the other way around

  3. Observer-expectancy effect - subconscious manipulation of experiment to achieve desired result

  4. Hindsight bias - modifying hypotheses after results (post-hoc) 

     â€‹						  - "Texas Sharpshooter"

  5. Availability heuristic - disregarding previous body of research

  6. Publication bias - non-significant results not seen as publishable

#### 4. Social perceptions and self-perceptions

* _Hindsight bias_ = tendency to perceive the already-know outcomes of an event as much more predictable than they were + feeling of knowing the outcome beforehand

  * Bias persists even if the participants are well informed about odds
  * Three levels - 
    1. Predictability - Self-serving bias ???
    2. Inevitability - Seeing the event chain makes us unable to un-see
    3. Memory distortion - We simply dont remember correctly all the facts, constructive nature of memory, false remembering

* _Cognitive dissonance_

  * When two counteracting beliefs are acted simultaneously it creates dissonance we try to solve. 
  * When our _conduct_ and our _beliefs_ clash, often will the beliefs change to _conform_ (or explain) our conduct. Many times this manifests in the form of excuses like "Its for the greater good" or "No one will know", especially when the conduct is immoral or otherwise wrong.

* _Fundamental attribution error_ - "I did something wrong because of the situation i was in and others did something wrong because they are like that" = tendency for people to under-emphasize situational explanations for an individual's observed behavior while over-emphasizing dispositional and personality-based explanations for their behavior

  |                    | Me        | Others    |
  | ------------------ | --------- | --------- |
  | Positive behaviour | Trait     | Situation |
  | Negative behaviour | Situation | Traiut    |

  

* _Self-serving bias_ - collecting/perceiving information in a way to support our pre-existing views or self interest

* _Barnum effect_ - perceiving general statements as tailored specifically to an individual on personal level (e.g. horoscopes, personality tests )

  * Generality of interpretation = true of almost all people but allow "projection" of many different experiences that are unique
  * Interpretation presented as personalized = people fail to think about generality of statements when they are presented as personal descriptions
  * Favourability = statements suggesting positive traits
  * Revelations =

* _Halo effect_ = tendency of our first impression of a person to "frame" our global impression of him/her in the future (for example good looking people are perceived as good with no evidence)

* _False consensus effect_ - tendency to overestimate how much other people agree with us, viewing our values and ides as "normal"

* __Conclusion__: knowledge of biases helps us be more honest but its demanding to be constantly aware of all these things and therefore biases may serve as heuristics - 'just in case' judgments if information processing is limited 

#### 5. Human perception, memory, and thought

#### 6. Development of personality and pathology
